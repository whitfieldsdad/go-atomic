Upon execution notepad.exe will be opened. \nThis has been used by Win32/Poweliks malware and works as described [here](https://www.stormshield.com/news/poweliks-command-line-confusion/)\n\nNote: The GetObject function is no longer supported in Internet Explorer v9 (2011) and later so this technique would only work where very old versions of IE are installed. \n",
