  "description": "This test executes the exported function `KRShowKeyMgr` located in `keymgr.dll` using `rundll32.exe`. It opens a window that allows to export stored Windows credentials from the credential manager to a file (`.crd` by default). The file can then be retrieved and imported on an attacker-controlled computer to list the credentials get the passwords. The only limitation is that it requires a CTRL+ALT+DELETE input from the attacker, which can be achieve multiple ways (e.g. a custom implant with remote control capabilities, enabling RDP, etc.).\nReference: https://twitter.com/0gtweet/status/1415671356239216653",
