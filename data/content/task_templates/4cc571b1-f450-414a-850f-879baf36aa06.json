  "name": "Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI",
  "description": "Uses the undocumented NtQueueAPCThreadEx WinAPI to create a \"Special User APC\" in the current thread of the current process to execute shellcode. \nSince the shellcode is loaded and executed in the current process it is considered local shellcode execution.\n\nSteps taken with this technique\n1. Allocate memory for the shellcode with VirtualAlloc setting the page permissions to Read/Write\n2. Use the RtlCopyMemory macro to copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space\n3. Change the memory page permissions to Execute/Read with VirtualProtect\n4. Get a handle to the current thread\n5. Execute the shellcode in the current thread by creating a Special User APC through the NtQueueApcThreadEx function\n\n- PoC Credit: (https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/go-shellcode/tree/master#rtlcreateuserthread)\n- References:\n  - https://repnz.github.io/posts/apc/user-apc/\n  - https://docs.rs/ntapi/0.3.1/ntapi/ntpsapi/fn.NtQueueApcThreadEx.html\n  - https://0x00sec.org/t/process-injection-apc-injection/24608\n  - https://twitter.com/aionescu/status/992264290924032005\n  - http://www.opening-windows.com/techart_windows_vista_apc_internals2.htm#_Toc229652505\n",
